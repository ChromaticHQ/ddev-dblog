## What is ddev-dblog?

When using ddev to develop in a framework with a database abstraction layer, it can be finicky to set up the ability to see the actual database queries generated by the application.

dblog is a custom ddev command that allows a user to easily turn on or off database query logging and to (optionally) tail that log.

Due to the noisy nature of database query log output, the command does not add the database queries to the `ddev logs` output but uses its own file within your db container to store the queries.

Database query logging will slow down your application, so this command is intended to be used briefly during troubleshooting, which is why it is designed the way it is.

## Getting started
Get and install your db log command

        ddev get ddev-dblog

## Using dblog

### Following (Tailing) queries

To follow the logs live (tail), do

        ddev dblog tail

which will tail the log file right in your current terminal window. `ctrl+c` to quit. When you quit tailing, the db query log is turned off automatically.

### Turn on db query logging
If you just want to turn on the logging so you can capture a bunch of output and examine it later, do

        ddev dblog on

You can find the logs in your db service at /tmp/dblog. Use

        ddev ssh -s db
        less /tmp/dblog

to page through it or search it.

### Turn off db query logging
Remember to turn off the db query logging. The logging is a drain on your application performance.

        ddev dblog off
